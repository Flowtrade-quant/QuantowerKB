This setting affects how often the **data will be updated** in the Dom reader/ You need to experiment and find the optimal setting for your region.

Too frequent updates of Dom Trader can lead to significant delays in data processing if you have a weak computer

The essence of scalping is to see **large orders in the stack** and act in the context of the market situation. Let's take a look at how I set up the Dom. And so for that let's go to the column settings and select Bids and Asks. At first I remove the gradient setting it is a little uncomfortable for my eyes. I want to see contrasting volumes. Observe the Dom and choose really **big volumes** and specify that value in the settings

Next, I specify my **standard volumes** for the trade. According to my money management I take the following shoulders 1, 2, 5,10, 20. It is very convenient to quickly change volume based on market situation.

For **instant order management** I use quick response panel and hotkeys/ I learned some hotkeys and use keyboard to trade. For example, I quickly close a position or flip a position from buying to selling.
