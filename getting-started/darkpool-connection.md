# ðŸ¥· DarkPool Connection

## DARK POOL INDEX & BLOCKS

you will see 2 Flow Trade connection feeds.  One says equities and the other one says Dark pool.  These data feeds are completely the same besides the use of the power trades tool.  The power trades tool Is out block and high volume scanner.  Unlike the web version were we only track the registered blocks that come through on the tape.  There are various settings on the scanner that allow you to isolate specific levels that may have HFT programs unloading small lots to be undetected.  These levels are just as critical as the block levels.  Please check out the Power trades tab or watch this video to learn more abou this tool.
