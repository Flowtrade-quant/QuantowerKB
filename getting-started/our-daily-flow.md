# ðŸ§  Our Daily Flow

_<mark style="color:red;">**How to navigate Discord Chat Room:**</mark>_

Once inside, youâ€™ll see three main groups of channels: â€˜Start Hereâ€™, â€˜Resourcesâ€™, and â€˜FlowTrade Mainâ€™.

The channels under â€˜Start Hereâ€™ and â€˜Resourcesâ€™ are self-explanatory, so feel free to poke around to get a feel for them.

Under â€˜Resourcesâ€™, youâ€™ll see the â€˜supportâ€™ channel. Whenever youâ€™re running into technical, billing, or membership issues, please use that channel to create a ticket for us to help solve your issue as quickly as possible.&#x20;

Now, letâ€™s get to the meat and potatoes of our Discord - the â€˜FlowTrade Mainâ€™ group of channels. Here is a brief description for each of the channels:&#x20;

The conversation starts about 10 minutes before the 9:30 AM market open and all members are encouraged to join because of the valuable information shared during this time - a lot can be learned during these calls.



_<mark style="color:blue;">**FLOWBOT-DATA**</mark>_ - This is where any FlowTrade member can type in commands to pull up unique market data such as general analysis, economy data, screeners, dark pool, options data, NFT, and crypto. Please reach out to one of the admins to learn how to use this channel and pull the data that youâ€™re looking for.

_<mark style="color:blue;">**FORUMS-**</mark>   Here you will find videos and topics on all of our tools as well as you can feel free to start a topic or ask questions about a current topic<mark style="color:blue;">**.**</mark>_

_<mark style="color:yellow;">**Best use of our Discord:**</mark>_ Throughout the day (even after market hours), feel free to get feedback on your trade set-ups, ask questions about any of the tools used, or discuss just about anything pertaining to trading. Everyone in the group is very welcoming and wants to see you succeed. The best and fastest way to learn is to speak up - we all started somewhere. It's a long lonely road trying to become a successful trader on your own. So please use the admin and Pros to your advantage. \

If you would like a private session for help on setting things up or just acclimated to the tools, please message Kirby and he will get you scheduled.

_<mark style="color:yellow;">**CLASSES & TRAINING**</mark>_

We hold free classes randomly throughout the week and on the weekends too. These classes can range from how to use our tools, to developing your trading system, to learning how to use dark pool data, to how to pass prop trading combines - just to name a few. As we progress, these classes will become more and more consistent.

If youâ€™re the type that prefers more one-on-one coaching, please feel free to reach out to [info@flowtrade.com](mailto:info@flowtrade.com) or submit a ticket under the â€˜supportâ€™ channel to let us know.\
